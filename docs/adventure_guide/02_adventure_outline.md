## Choosing Source Material

### Criteria for Good Adventures

Your source material should meet most of these criteria:

- ✅ **Rich narrative tradition** - Myths, epics, classic literature with established storytelling
- ✅ **Complex themes** - Suitable for analysis and discussion (not just plot)
- ✅ **Cultural or historical significance** - Something worth studying
- ✅ **Multiple story arcs or episodes** - Enough content for 5+ chapters
- ✅ **Visual and cinematic potential** - Can be brought to life with images/scenes

### Good Examples

**Excellent Choices:**
- Arabian Nights (frame narrative, multiple stories)
- Dante's Inferno (journey structure, clear themes)
- Greek Mythology (multiple interconnected tales)
- Arthurian Legends (episodic adventures)
- Epic of Gilgamesh (archetypal hero's journey)
- Canterbury Tales (frame narrative, varied stories)

**Good Choices:**
- Shakespeare plays (rich language, complex characters)
- Beowulf (heroic epic, cultural significance)
- The Odyssey (journey structure)
- Norse Mythology (interconnected tales)

**Challenging (but possible):**
- Contemporary novels - Watch for copyright issues
- Highly abstract philosophy - Difficult to visualize
- Short stories - May lack content for multiple chapters

### Quick Evaluation Checklist

Before committing to a source material, ask:

- [ ] Can I identify 5+ distinct chapter topics?
- [ ] Are there meaningful themes to analyze?
- [ ] Can I visualize key scenes and settings?
- [ ] Will this engage 16-20 year olds?
- [ ] Is there enough educational value?
- [ ] Do I have access to the source text?

## Defining Learning Objectives

### Adventure-Level Objectives (3-5 goals)

These are the **big picture** educational outcomes for the entire adventure. Students should be able to achieve these after completing all chapters.

**Format:** Use action verbs (Understand, Analyze, Explore, Recognize, Compare)

**Template:**
```
[Adventure Title]: Learning Objectives

1. Understand [major concept or structure]
2. Analyze [cultural, historical, or thematic element]
3. Explore [universal themes or ideas]
4. Recognize [techniques, patterns, or relationships]
5. Compare [perspectives, traditions, or approaches]
```

**Example: Arabian Nights**
```

2. Analyze allegorical structure and symbolic meaning
3. Explore how literature reflects historical and cultural values
4. Recognize poetic techniques in epic narrative
5. Compare medieval and modern moral frameworks
```

### Chapter-Level Objectives (3-5 per chapter)

These are **specific, measurable** outcomes for each individual chapter. They should:

- Build toward adventure-level objectives
- Be testable in the chapter quiz
- Progress in complexity (Chapter 1 easier than Chapter 5)
- Use specific action verbs

**Template:**
```
Chapter [X]: [Chapter Title]

Learning Objectives:
- [Action verb] [specific concept from this chapter]
- [Action verb] [character, theme, or technique specific to chapter]
- [Action verb] [connection to broader theme]
```

**Example: Arabian Nights - Chapter 1**
```
Chapter 1: Scheherazade and the Frame Story

Learning Objectives:
- Identify the frame narrative structure and its purpose
- Understand Scheherazade's use of storytelling as survival

```

```
Chapter 2: The Dark Wood and Descent Begins

Learning Objectives:
- Understand the symbolism of the dark wood and Virgil's role
- Recognize allegorical meaning in Dante's journey
- Identify the structure of Hell's circles
- Analyze how personal crisis drives the narrative
```

### Bloom's Taxonomy Reference

Use a variety of cognitive levels:

| Level | Verbs | % of Objectives |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Remember/Understand** | Identify, Describe, Explain, Summarize | 40% |
| **Apply/Analyze** | Demonstrate, Compare, Examine, Analyze | 40% |
| **Evaluate/Create** | Assess, Critique, Evaluate, Design | 20% |
