## Chapter Development Workflow

**For each chapter, follow these steps:**

1. ✅ **Write chapter outline** (in `ADVENTURE_OUTLINE.md`)
2. ✅ **Create chapter file** (`chapters/chapter-X-name.ts`)
3. ✅ **Define learning objectives** (3-5 measurable goals)
4. ✅ **Write scene outlines** (8-15 scenes with type selection)
5. ✅ **Implement scenes one by one** (start with narrative, add interactive)
6. ✅ **Add learning points to each scene** (1-3 per scene)
7. ✅ **Create chapter quiz** (see Phase 6)
8. ✅ **Test chapter playthrough** (full walkthrough)
9. ✅ **Refine and polish** (based on testing)

**Key Principle:** Build incrementally. Complete each scene fully before moving to the next.

## Chapter File Template

### Basic Structure

```typescript
// chapters/chapter-1-opening.ts
import type { Chapter } from '../../../types';
import { chapter1Quiz } from '../quizzes/chapter-1-quiz';

export const chapter1: Chapter = {
  id: 'chapter-1-your-adventure',
  title: 'Chapter 1: [Title]',
  description: 'Brief 1-2 sentence summary of this chapter',

  // Optional: Only if non-sequential unlocking
  // prerequisites: { type: 'sequential' },

  learningObjectives: [
    'Objective 1: [Action verb] [concept]',
    'Objective 2: [Action verb] [concept]',
    'Objective 3: [Action verb] [concept]',
  ],

  scenes: [
    // Scene implementations here (see examples below)
  ],

  endQuiz: chapter1Quiz,
};
```

### Minimal Opening Scene Example

```typescript
scenes: [
  // Scene 1: Opening narrative
  {
    id: 'scene-ch1-1-opening',
    type: 'narrative',
    backgroundImage: '/assets/your-adventure/backgrounds/opening.png',

    content: `Your opening narrative text here.

    Keep paragraphs to 2-4 sentences. Use double line breaks for paragraph separation.

    Start with a hook that captures attention immediately.`,

    learningPoints: [
      {
        id: 'lp-ch1-1-context',
        content: 'First learning point: introduce a key concept or context.',
        category: 'historical-context',
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

### Decision Scene Example

```typescript
{
  id: 'scene-ch1-2-decision',
  type: 'decision',
  backgroundImage: '/assets/your-adventure/backgrounds/crossroads.png',

  prompt: 'What will you do?',
  context: 'Set up the decision with 1-2 paragraphs of context.',

  choices: [
    {
      id: 'choice-option-a',
      text: 'First option text',
      consequence: 'What happens if they choose this.',
      learningPoints: [
        {
          id: 'lp-ch1-2a-theme',
          content: 'What this choice teaches about the theme.',
          category: 'thematic-analysis',
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: 'choice-option-b',
      text: 'Second option text',
      consequence: 'Alternative outcome.',
    },
  ],

  learningPoints: [],
}
```

### Final Scene with Quiz Trigger

```typescript
{
  id: 'scene-ch1-final',
  type: 'narrative',
  backgroundImage: '/assets/your-adventure/backgrounds/chapter-end.png',

  content: `Chapter conclusion text.

  Summarize key points and transition to quiz.`,

  learningPoints: [
    {
      id: 'lp-ch1-final-synthesis',
      content: 'Final synthesizing learning point.',
      category: 'thematic-analysis',
    },

  events: {
    onExit: [{
      type: 'quiz',
      componentId: 'quiz-chapter-1',
      condition: { type: 'if-not-completed' },
    }],
  },
}
```

```

### Typical Chapter Flow (8-15 scenes)

**Chapter 1 (Introduction):**
```
1. Narrative (opening)
2. Narrative (context)
3. Decision (simple choice)
4. Narrative (continuation)
5. Quote Attribution (easy test)
6. Narrative (development)
7. Decision (meaningful choice)
8. Narrative (conclusion + quiz trigger)
```

**Chapter 3 (Mid-adventure complexity):**
```
1. Narrative (setup)
2. Map Exploration (geography)
3. Narrative (story continuation)
4. Dialogue (character depth)
5. Narrative (plot twist)
6. Timeline Game (chronology test)
7. Narrative (development)
8. Cause-Effect (relationships)
9. Narrative (climax)
10. Primary Source (analysis)
11. Narrative (resolution + quiz trigger)
```

**Balance Guidelines:**
- **Story scenes (narrative/decision/dialogue):** 60-70%
- **Interactive scenes (games/exploration):** 30-40%
- **Total scenes per chapter:** 8-15

---

## Writing Narrative Content

### Content Structure

**Paragraphs:**
- Use double newlines to separate paragraphs
- Keep each paragraph to 2-4 sentences
- Total scene length: 150-400 words

**Example:**
```typescript
content: `This is the first paragraph. It introduces the scene and sets the stage. Keep it concise but vivid.

This is the second paragraph. It continues the narrative and adds depth. Notice the double newline between paragraphs.

This is the conclusion. It provides a transition or calls to action.`
```

### Writing Style Guidelines

**Do:**
- ✅ Use **second person** ("you") for player agency
- ✅ Write in **present tense** for immediacy
- ✅ Use **active voice** for clarity
- ✅ Start with a **hook** that grabs attention
- ✅ End with **momentum** toward next scene
- ✅ Include **sensory details** (sights, sounds, textures)
- ✅ Balance **storytelling with teaching** (70/30 split)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Use overly complex vocabulary (unless teaching it)
- ❌ Write paragraphs longer than 5 sentences
- ❌ Include multiple major concepts in one scene
- ❌ Assume prior knowledge without explanation
- ❌ Use passive voice unnecessarily

### Example: Good vs. Bad Narrative

**Bad:**
```typescript
content: `The Arabian Nights was compiled over many centuries from various sources including Persian, Arabic, Indian, and Egyptian traditions. It is considered one of the most important works of literature in human history and has influenced countless writers and artists across the globe. The frame narrative structure is particularly noteworthy as it demonstrates sophisticated literary techniques that were ahead of their time.`
```

**Problems:**
- Too dense (3 major concepts in one paragraph)
- Passive voice ("was compiled", "is considered")
- Academic tone (not engaging)
- No sensory details or narrative voice

**Good:**
```typescript
content: `Welcome to the magical world of the Arabian Nights!

The collection known as "One Thousand and One Nights" is one of the most influential works of literature in human history. These tales, compiled over centuries from sources across Persia, Arabia, India, and Egypt, have captivated audiences worldwide.

But before we dive into the famous adventures of Aladdin, Ali Baba, and Sinbad, we must first understand the remarkable frame story that holds all these tales together...`
```

**Why it works:**
- Engaging opening hook ("Welcome...")
- Conversational tone with active voice
- Breaks concepts into digestible paragraphs
- Uses "we" to include the player
- Creates anticipation for what's next

## Adding Learning Points

### Learning Point Anatomy

```typescript
learningPoints: [
  {
    id: 'lp-unique-identifier',              // Unique across entire adventure
    content: 'Educational insight (1-2 sentences)', // The actual learning
    category: 'historical-context',           // Categorization
  },
]
```

### Categories

Use these standard categories for consistency:

| Category | Use For | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `historical-context` | Historical facts and background | "The Arabian Nights was compiled over 8 centuries" |
| `literary-technique` | Writing craft and structure | "Frame narratives create layers of meaning" |
| `character-analysis` | Character development and psychology | "Scheherazade embodies courage and wisdom" |
| `thematic-analysis` | Themes, symbols, meanings | "Storytelling as a tool for survival and transformation" |
| `plot-structure` | Narrative structure and pacing | "The cliffhanger technique keeps audiences engaged" |
| `cultural-context` | Cultural customs and worldview | "A vizier was a high-ranking political adviser" |
| `narrative-structure` | Story framing and organization | "The tale within a tale creates complexity" |
| `literary-significance` | Impact and influence | "These stories influenced Shakespeare and Dickens" |

### Best Practices

**Do:**
- ✅ Write 1-3 learning points per scene
- ✅ Keep each to 1-2 sentences maximum
- ✅ Be specific and concrete (not vague)
- ✅ Connect to the current scene directly
- ✅ Build on previous learning points
- ✅ Use vivid comparisons and metaphors
- ✅ Focus on insights, not just facts

**Don't:**
- ❌ Create generic learning points ("Stories are interesting")
- ❌ Write long paragraphs (save for content)
- ❌ Repeat information already in the content
- ❌ Use overly academic language
- ❌ Mix multiple concepts in one point

### Examples: Good vs. Bad Learning Points

**Bad:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'lp-1',
  content: 'This is important to know.',
  category: 'general',
}
```
**Problems:** Vague, no specific learning, generic category

**Good:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'lp-frame-narrative',
  content: 'Frame narratives create layers of meaning by embedding stories within stories, like Russian nesting dolls.',
  category: 'literary-technique',
}
```
**Why it works:** Specific technique, vivid metaphor, concrete

---

**Bad:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'lp-sultan',
  content: 'The Sultan was betrayed by his wife and became angry so he decided to execute all his future wives at dawn which made everyone in the kingdom very sad and many people left.',
  category: 'plot',
}
```
**Problems:** Too long, multiple concepts, plot summary not learning

**Good:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'lp-sultan-transformation',
  content: 'Sultan Shahryar\'s transformation shows how personal trauma can corrupt even just rulers.',
  category: 'character-analysis',
}
```
**Why it works:** Analytical, concise, teaches character psychology

---

**Bad:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'lp-scheherazade',
  content: 'Scheherazade was smart.',
  category: 'character',
}
```
**Problems:** Superficial, no insight

**Good:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'lp-scheherazade-power',
  content: 'Scheherazade uses storytelling as a tool for survival and transformation, showing that intellect can triumph over violence.',
  category: 'thematic-analysis',
}
```
**Why it works:** Deep insight, thematic connection, reveals strategy

---

## Using Inline Annotations

### What Are Inline Annotations?

Inline annotations are interactive tooltips that appear when players hover over (or tap on mobile) specific words or phrases in narrative text. They provide contextual educational information without interrupting the narrative flow.

**Complete documentation:** See `docs/FEATURE_INLINE_ANNOTATIONS.md`

### When to Use Annotations

**Use annotations for:**
- ✅ Historical paradoxes or anachronisms (e.g., "China" in Aladdin)
- ✅ Cultural context that enriches understanding
- ✅ Literary techniques being demonstrated in the text
- ✅ References modern readers might miss
- ✅ Specialized vocabulary or terms
- ✅ Name pronunciations or meanings
- ✅ Interesting tangents that would break narrative flow

**Don't use annotations for:**
- ❌ Core plot information (put in main content)
- ❌ Information essential to understanding (make explicit)
- ❌ Common knowledge terms
- ❌ Concepts better suited to learning points

### Implementation

```typescript
{
  id: 'scene-with-annotations',
  type: 'narrative',

  content: `In a city in China, there once lived a poor boy named Aladdin...`,

  inlineAnnotations: [
    {
      id: 'annotation-china',
      text: 'China',  // Exact text to underline in content
      tooltip: {
        title: 'Why "China"?',
        content: 'The story says "China," but everything about it is Middle Eastern. To medieval audiences, "China" meant "far-off exotic land." Fantasy worldbuilding, not geography!',
        category: 'literary-context',
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

**Result:** The word "China" will be underlined with a dotted line. When players hover/tap, they see the tooltip with title and explanation.

### Guidelines

**Content:**
- Keep tooltip content to 1-3 sentences
- Make discoveries, not lectures
- Use conversational tone
- Provide "aha!" moments

**Quantity:**
- Maximum 3-4 annotations per scene
- Less is more (don't overuse)
- Only annotate if it genuinely enhances understanding

**Categories:**
```typescript
category: 'historical-context'  // Historical facts
category: 'cultural-context'    // Cultural customs
category: 'literary-context'    // Literary techniques
category: 'pronunciation'       // Name/word pronunciation
category: 'etymology'           // Word origins
```

### Example from Arabian Nights

```typescript
{
  id: 'scene-2-sultan-betrayal',
  type: 'narrative',

  content: `Long ago, in the lands between India and China, there ruled a powerful sultan named Shahryar...`,

  inlineAnnotations: [
    {
      id: 'sultan-shahryar',
      text: 'Shahryar',
      tooltip: {
        title: 'The Sultan\'s Name',
        content: 'Shahryar (shah-ree-YAR) means "friend of the city" in Persian. The name emphasizes his role as protector-turned-tyrant, making his transformation more dramatic.',
        category: 'cultural-context',
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

---

## Quiz Trigger Setup

### Basic Quiz Trigger

Add to the **last scene** of the chapter:

```typescript
{
  id: 'scene-ch1-final',
  type: 'narrative',
  // ... content and learning points ...

  events: {
    onExit: [{
      type: 'quiz',
      componentId: 'quiz-chapter-1',  // Must match quiz ID
      condition: { type: 'if-not-completed' },
    }],
  },
}
```

**How it works:**
1. Player completes final scene
2. Clicks "Continue"
3. If quiz not already completed → Quiz launches
4. If quiz already completed → Advances to next chapter

### Multiple Event Triggers (Advanced)

You can trigger multiple events:

```typescript
events: {
  onExit: [
    {
      type: 'quiz',
      componentId: 'quiz-chapter-1',
      condition: { type: 'if-not-completed' },
    },
    {
      type: 'achievement',
      componentId: 'achievement-complete-chapter-1',
      condition: { type: 'always' },
    },
  ],
}
```

### Conditional Triggers (Advanced)

```typescript
events: {
  onExit: [{
    type: 'quiz',
    componentId: 'quiz-chapter-1',
    condition: {
      type: 'if-condition',
      check: 'visited-all-locations',  // Custom condition
    },
  }],
}
```

**Note:** Conditional triggers beyond `if-not-completed` require custom implementation in the engine.

## Best Practices

### Planning Before Writing

**Do this first:**
1. Outline all scenes with types in `ADVENTURE_OUTLINE.md`
2. Map learning objectives to specific scenes
3. Identify which assets you'll need
4. Plan the narrative arc (setup → conflict → resolution)

### Building Incrementally

**Start with:**
- Core narrative scenes (the story backbone)
- Learning points for each scene
- Simple decisions or dialogue

**Then add:**
- Interactive scenes (games, exploration)
- Inline annotations
- Optional media (images, videos)

### Testing as You Go

**After every 3-4 scenes:**
- Play through from chapter start
- Verify navigation works
- Check that learning points appear
- Ensure assets load properly
- Confirm quiz trigger at end

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Content Mistakes:**
- ❌ Too much text per scene (>500 words)
- ❌ Too many narrative scenes in a row (>3)
- ❌ Decisions without meaningful consequences
- ❌ Interactive scenes without clear instructions
- ❌ Missing transitions between scenes

**Technical Mistakes:**
- ❌ Duplicate IDs across scenes
- ❌ Wrong asset paths
- ❌ Missing learning points
- ❌ Quiz trigger on wrong scene
- ❌ No quiz trigger at all

**Educational Mistakes:**
- ❌ Learning objectives not addressed in content
- ❌ Learning points too vague or generic
- ❌ No connection between scenes and quiz questions
- ❌ Concepts introduced but never reinforced
- ❌ Assuming prior knowledge without teaching it

### Pacing Guidelines

**Scene Distribution:**
- Opening: 1-2 narrative scenes (setup)
- Early: 2-3 story scenes with 1 simple interactive (engagement)
- Middle: Alternating story and interactive (development)
- Late: 1-2 story scenes with complex interactive (climax)
- End: 1 narrative scene (resolution + quiz trigger)

**Timing Targets:**
- Individual scene: 2-5 minutes
- Chapter total: 30-45 minutes
- Interactive scenes: 30-40% of total
- Story scenes: 60-70% of total

### Scene Type Variety

**Aim for:**
- At least 3 different scene types per chapter
- No more than 3 consecutive narrative scenes
- At least 2 interactive scenes per chapter
- Progressive complexity (simple → complex)

**Example variety:**
```
✅ Good: Narrative → Narrative → Decision → Narrative → Map Exploration → Narrative → Timeline → Narrative
❌ Bad: Narrative → Narrative → Narrative → Narrative → Narrative → Narrative → Narrative → Narrative
```
