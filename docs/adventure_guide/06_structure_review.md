# Structure Review Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** October 2025

## Purpose

This guide helps you verify that scenes within each chapter are in a logical order with proper narrative flow. Good structure ensures players have context for interactive elements, prevents jarring transitions, and maintains appropriate pacing throughout the educational experience.

---

## Why Structure Review Matters

**Poor structure leads to:**
- Confusion (mini-game without setup)
- Boredom (too many narratives in a row)
- Disconnect (abrupt tone shifts)
- Wasted educational value (interactive scenes before context)

**Good structure creates:**
- Clear narrative flow
- Proper learning scaffolding
- Appropriate pacing
- Engaged players

---

## What to Check

### 1. Scene Sequence Logic

**Check that:**
- Each scene flows naturally to the next
- Story beats follow a coherent arc (setup → conflict → resolution)
- No scenes feel "out of place" in the narrative
- Transitions between scenes make sense

**Example of good sequence:**
```
Scene 1: Narrative (Introduction to Aladdin, the poor boy)
Scene 2: Narrative (Magician arrives, offers opportunity)
Scene 3: Decision (Enter the cave or refuse?)
Scene 4: Narrative (Discovery of the lamp)
```

**Example of poor sequence:**
```
Scene 1: Narrative (Introduction to Aladdin)
Scene 2: Quote Attribution (Who said these lines?) ❌ TOO EARLY - no context
Scene 3: Narrative (Magician arrives)
Scene 4: Narrative (Cave entrance)
```

### 2. Context Before Interaction

**Rule:** Interactive scenes (especially mini-games) MUST have adequate narrative context first.

**Check that:**
- Players understand WHO they're learning about before quote attribution
- Players know WHAT happened before timeline ordering
- Players have been introduced to concepts before cause-effect matching
- Map exploration scenes have narrative setup explaining the geography's importance
- Anachronism scenes clearly establish the time period

**Good pattern:**
```
Narrative (Scheherazade tells stories to the Sultan) →
Narrative (Over 1001 nights, her tales captivate him) →
Quote Attribution (Who said these famous lines from the tales?)
```

**Bad pattern:**
```
Narrative (Brief intro to Arabian Nights) →
Quote Attribution (Who said these lines?) ❌ Players don't know the characters yet!
```

### 3. Mini-Game Setup

**Every mini-game needs:**
- **Narrative setup** (1-2 scenes before) establishing relevant context
- **Clear instructions** in the scene prompt
- **Appropriate placement** in chapter flow (not too early, not bunched together)

**Checklist per mini-game type:**

| Mini-Game Type | Needs Before It |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Quote Attribution** | Introduction to all characters quoted (1-3 scenes) |
| **Timeline Game** | Narrative describing the events to be ordered (2-4 scenes) |
| **Cause-Effect** | Explanation of the relationships being tested (2-3 scenes) |
| **Map Exploration** | Context for why geography matters (1-2 scenes) |
| **Anachronism** | Clear establishment of time period (1 scene minimum) |
| **Primary Source** | Background on the historical context (1-2 scenes) |

**Example of good mini-game setup:**
```
Scene 5: Narrative (Sinbad's first voyage begins)
Scene 6: Narrative (He encounters a whale, a giant bird, and a valley of diamonds)
Scene 7: Narrative (He returns home with treasures)
Scene 8: Timeline Game (Order the events of Sinbad's first voyage)
```

**Example of poor mini-game setup:**
```
Scene 1: Narrative (Brief introduction to Sinbad)
Scene 2: Timeline Game (Order Sinbad's voyages) ❌ No context provided yet!
```

### 4. Pacing Variation

**Check that:**
- No more than 3 narrative scenes in a row
- Interactive scenes are distributed evenly throughout the chapter
- Decision or dialogue scenes break up long narrative stretches
- Each chapter has 30-40% interactive scenes, 60-70% narrative

**Good pacing example:**
```
Narrative → Narrative → Decision → Narrative → Dialogue → Narrative → Timeline Game → Narrative
```

**Poor pacing example:**
```
Narrative → Narrative → Narrative → Narrative → Narrative ❌ BORING!
Decision → Quote Attribution → Map Exploration → Timeline Game ❌ TOO MUCH interaction without story!
```

### 5. Tone Consistency

**Check for:**
- No sudden shifts from serious to comedic without reason
- Emotional beats properly spaced (don't jump from tragedy to joy instantly)
- Interactive scenes match the tone of surrounding narrative
- Background images and music support the tone

**Jarring transition example:**
```
Scene 7: Narrative (The magician imprisons Aladdin in the cave, leaving him to die)
Scene 8: Quote Attribution (Match these funny quotes!) ❌ Tone mismatch!
```

**Smooth transition example:**
```
Scene 7: Narrative (Aladdin is trapped in the cave)
Scene 8: Narrative (He discovers the ring genie and escapes)
Scene 9: Decision (What should Aladdin do with the lamp?)
```

### 6. Learning Point Progression

**Check that:**
- Early scenes introduce foundational concepts
- Middle scenes build on those foundations
- Later scenes synthesize multiple concepts
- Learning points in interactive scenes reference earlier narrative concepts

**Good progression:**
```
Scene 1: LP: "Folk tales often feature humble beginnings" (introduction)
Scene 4: LP: "Magical helpers represent inner potential" (concept)
Scene 8: LP: "Transformation requires character growth, not just circumstances" (synthesis)
```

**Poor progression:**
```
Scene 1: LP: "Complex meta-narrative framing techniques" ❌ Too advanced!
Scene 8: LP: "Stories have characters" ❌ Too basic!
```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Interactive Scene Too Early

**Symptom:** Mini-game appears before players have necessary context

**Example:**
```
Scene 1: Narrative (Introduction to Arabian Nights)
Scene 2: Quote Attribution (Who said these quotes?)
```

**Fix:** Add narrative scenes before the interactive scene
```
Scene 1: Narrative (Introduction to Arabian Nights)
Scene 2: Narrative (Scheherazade's plan)
Scene 3: Narrative (First night of storytelling)
Scene 4: Quote Attribution (Who said these quotes from the tales?)
```

---

### Issue 2: Too Many Consecutive Narratives

**Symptom:** 4+ narrative scenes in a row

**Example:**
```
Scene 3: Narrative
Scene 4: Narrative
Scene 5: Narrative
Scene 6: Narrative
Scene 7: Narrative ❌
```

**Fix:** Insert interactive scenes to break up the narrative flow
```
Scene 3: Narrative
Scene 4: Narrative
Scene 5: Decision (Player makes a choice)
Scene 6: Narrative
Scene 7: Dialogue (Character interaction)
Scene 8: Narrative
```

---

### Issue 3: Mini-Game Without Explanation

**Symptom:** Players don't understand why they're doing the activity

**Example:**
```
Scene 5: Narrative (Brief mention of multiple locations)
Scene 6: Map Exploration (Explore Baghdad) ❌ Why? What's the significance?
```

**Fix:** Add context explaining the purpose
```
Scene 5: Narrative (Sinbad must journey through many lands)
Scene 6: Narrative (Each location holds a different danger and treasure)
Scene 7: Map Exploration (Trace Sinbad's route and discover each location)
```

---

### Issue 4: Abrupt Tone Shifts

**Symptom:** Emotional whiplash between scenes

**Example:**
```
Scene 8: Narrative (The princess is kidnapped! All seems lost!)
Scene 9: Quote Attribution (Match these fun quotes!) ❌
```

**Fix:** Either move the mini-game or adjust its tone
```
Scene 8: Narrative (The princess is kidnapped!)
Scene 9: Decision (How should Aladdin respond?)
Scene 10: Narrative (Aladdin formulates a rescue plan)
Scene 11: Quote Attribution (moved to after resolution)
```

---

### Issue 5: Interactive Scenes Bunched Together

**Symptom:** Multiple mini-games with no narrative breaks

**Example:**
```
Scene 7: Timeline Game
Scene 8: Quote Attribution
Scene 9: Map Exploration ❌
```

**Fix:** Intersperse narrative scenes
```
Scene 7: Timeline Game
Scene 8: Narrative (Continuation of story)
Scene 9: Narrative (Development continues)
Scene 10: Quote Attribution
Scene 11: Narrative
Scene 12: Map Exploration
```

---

### Issue 6: Weak Chapter Opening

**Symptom:** Chapter starts with interactive scene or insufficient introduction

**Example:**
```
Scene 1: Decision (What should the hero do?) ❌ No context!
```

**Fix:** Always start with narrative setup
```
Scene 1: Narrative (Introduction to setting and character)
Scene 2: Narrative (Inciting incident)
Scene 3: Decision (Now the player has context for the choice)
```

---

### Issue 7: Weak Chapter Ending

**Symptom:** Chapter ends abruptly or on mini-game

**Example:**
```
Scene 14: Map Exploration
Scene 15: [Quiz trigger] ❌
```

**Fix:** End with narrative conclusion
```
Scene 14: Map Exploration
Scene 15: Narrative (Story resolution and reflection)
Scene 16: Narrative (Transition or Scheherazade frame) [Quiz trigger]
```

## Good vs Bad Sequence Examples

### Example 1: Chapter Opening

**BAD:**
```
Scene 1: Narrative (Brief intro)
Scene 2: Quote Attribution (Who said these lines?)
Scene 3: Narrative (Story begins)
```
**Problem:** Interactive scene too early, no context for quotes

**GOOD:**
```
Scene 1: Narrative (Introduction to characters and setting)
Scene 2: Narrative (Story unfolds, key moments)
Scene 3: Decision (Player makes meaningful choice)
Scene 4: Narrative (Consequences of choice)
```
**Why:** Adequate setup, player has context for decision

---

### Example 2: Chapter Middle

**BAD:**
```
Scene 5: Narrative
Scene 6: Narrative
Scene 7: Narrative
Scene 8: Narrative
Scene 9: Narrative
```
**Problem:** Too many narratives, players get bored

**GOOD:**
```
Scene 5: Narrative (Story development)
Scene 6: Narrative (Conflict builds)
Scene 7: Dialogue (Character interaction)
Scene 8: Narrative (More development)
Scene 9: Timeline Game (Order key events)
Scene 10: Narrative (Story continues)
```
**Why:** Variation in scene types maintains engagement

---

### Example 3: Mini-Game Placement

**BAD:**
```
Scene 3: Narrative (Sinbad begins his voyage)
Scene 4: Timeline Game (Order all seven voyages) ❌
```
**Problem:** Players haven't experienced the voyages yet

**GOOD:**
```
Scene 3: Narrative (First voyage: the whale island)
Scene 4: Narrative (Second voyage: the valley of diamonds)
Scene 5: Narrative (Third voyage: the giant encounter)
Scene 6: Narrative (Return home)
Scene 7: Timeline Game (Order the events from Sinbad's first voyage)
```
**Why:** Players have context for all events being ordered

---

### Example 4: Chapter Ending

**BAD:**
```
Scene 13: Narrative (Story concludes)
Scene 14: Cause-Effect Game ❌ [Quiz trigger]
```
**Problem:** Chapter ends on mini-game, no narrative closure

**GOOD:**
```
Scene 13: Narrative (Climax resolution)
Scene 14: Cause-Effect Game (Review key relationships)
Scene 15: Narrative (Reflection on themes)
Scene 16: Narrative (Scheherazade frame, conclusion) [Quiz trigger]
```
**Why:** Proper closure with narrative, mini-game is review not ending

---

### Example 5: Full Chapter (Good Structure)

**Aladdin Chapter (15 scenes):**
```
1. Narrative - Introduction (poor boy Aladdin)
2. Narrative - Magician arrives
3. Decision - Enter the cave?
4. Narrative - Lamp discovery
5. Decision - Trapped in cave, what to do?
6. Narrative - Genie appears
7. Dialogue - First wish conversation
8. Narrative - Years pass, transformation
9. Decision - How to approach Sultan?
10. Narrative - Marriage and palace
11. Narrative - Magician returns
12. Narrative - Crisis (palace stolen)
13. Decision - Rescue plan
14. Narrative - Victory
15. Narrative - Conclusion and Scheherazade frame [Quiz]
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Opens with narrative setup (scenes 1-2)
- ✅ Interactive scenes have context (decisions after setup)
- ✅ No more than 2 narratives in a row
- ✅ Dialogue placed mid-chapter for engagement
- ✅ Closes with narrative reflection
- ✅ 40% interactive (6/15), 60% narrative (9/15)
- ✅ Logical flow throughout

## How to Conduct Structure Review

### Step 1: Create Scene Map

List all scenes with types:
```
1. Narrative
2. Narrative
3. Decision
4. Narrative
5. Dialogue
...
```

### Step 2: Check Patterns

Look for:
- Long stretches of same type
- Interactive scenes without setup
- Weak opening/closing
- Poor pacing

### Step 3: Test Flow

Read through scene descriptions in order:
- Does each scene follow naturally?
- Is there enough context for interactive scenes?
- Does the story arc make sense?

### Step 4: Review Learning Points

Check that learning points:
- Start simple, build complexity
- Connect across scenes
- Support mini-game concepts

### Step 5: Make Adjustments

Common fixes:
- **Add narrative** before early interactive scenes
- **Insert decision/dialogue** to break up long narrative stretches
- **Move mini-games** later in chapter
- **Add closing narrative** if ending abruptly
- **Reorder scenes** for better flow

### Step 6: Verify Checklist

Go through the Chapter Structure Checklist above for each chapter.

---

## Quick Reference: Scene Sequence Patterns

### Pattern 1: Standard Chapter Flow
```
N → N → D → N → I → N → N → D → N → I → N
(N = Narrative, D = Decision/Dialogue, I = Interactive Mini-Game)
```

### Pattern 2: Interactive-Heavy Chapter
```
N → N → D → I → N → D → N → I → N → D → I → N → N
```

### Pattern 3: Dialogue-Focused Chapter
```
N → N → D → N → DI → N → I → N → DI → N → N
(DI = Dialogue)
```

### Pattern 4: Exploration Chapter
```
N → N → N → ME → N → D → N → TG → N → N
(ME = Map Exploration, TG = Timeline Game)
```

## Red Flags

Watch for these warning signs:

| Red Flag | Problem | Fix |
|----------|---------|-----|
| 4+ narratives in a row | Boring | Add decision/dialogue |
| Interactive scene in scenes 1-2 | No context | Move later, add setup |
| Chapter ends on mini-game | Abrupt | Add closing narrative |
| 5+ interactive scenes in 10-scene chapter | Over-gamified | Convert some to narrative |
| 2+ mini-games back-to-back | Exhausting | Add narrative between |
| No decisions/dialogue in entire chapter | Low engagement | Add 1-2 choice moments |
| Mini-game mentions concepts not yet covered | Confusing | Move later or add context |

---

## Structure Review Workflow

When reviewing chapter structure:

1. **Read the outline** - Understand the intended story arc
2. **Map the scenes** - Create visual scene type map
3. **Check opening** - Strong narrative setup?
4. **Check development** - Good pacing and variety?
5. **Check mini-games** - Adequate setup for each?
6. **Check climax** - Appropriate tension and scene types?
7. **Check closing** - Proper narrative resolution?
8. **Check overall** - Flow, pacing, learning progression?
9. **Make fixes** - Reorder, add, or adjust scenes as needed
10. **Re-check** - Verify fixes solved issues

---

## When to Conduct Structure Review

**Timing:** After all chapters are written but BEFORE quiz creation

**Why:**
- Ensures coherent narrative flow
- Catches structural issues early
- Prevents confusion in quiz design
- Saves time by fixing structure before quizzes reference it

**Integration with workflow:**
1. File Structure Setup
2. Adventure Outline
3. Asset Planning
4. Theme Configuration
5. Chapter Development
6. **→ STRUCTURE REVIEW ← (YOU ARE HERE)**
7. Quiz Creation
8. Type & Lint Checking
9. Asset Integration
