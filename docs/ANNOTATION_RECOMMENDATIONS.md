## Annotation Criteria

Good candidates for annotations:

- **Literary devices or parallels** worth highlighting
- **Names with interesting etymology** or pronunciation
- **References to mythology** or folklore
- **Cultural practices** that aren't obvious

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Implement Now (Completed Chapters)
1. ✅ **Chapter 3, Scene 1**: "China" and "Aladdin" (DONE)
2. **Chapter 1**: Add 3-4 annotations (Shahryar, Scheherazade, 1001 nights, vizier)
3. **Chapter 2**: Add 2-3 annotations (jinn, sheikh, Persian carpet)

### Phase 2: When Content is Finalized
4. **Chapter 3**: Add sultan and genie annotations
5. **Chapter 4**: Add Persia, Open Sesame, Morgiana (when content is complete)
6. **Chapter 5**: Add Harun al-Rashid, Roc, Cyclops parallel (when content is complete)

## Content Guidelines Refresher

**Keep annotations:**
- SHORT (1-3 sentences max)
- INTERESTING (start with the hook, not the definition)
- DISCOVERABLE (users should feel rewarded for hovering)
- RELEVANT (enhance understanding without breaking immersion)

**Avoid:**
- Over-annotation (max 3-4 per scene)
- Obvious information
- Breaking narrative flow unnecessarily
- Lecturing tone

## Next Steps

1. Implement Chapter 1 annotations (Scheherazade, Shahryar, 1001 nights)
2. Implement Chapter 2 annotations (jinn, sheikh)
3. Review and test all annotations for tone and clarity
4. Add remaining annotations to Chapters 4-5 when content is finalized
