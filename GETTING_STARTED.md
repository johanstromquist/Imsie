I've created a complete scaffolding for Imsie - an interactive educational platform for history and literature adventures. Here's what's ready to use:

### ✅ Completed Components

1. **Full React + TypeScript + Vite Setup**
   - Modern build tooling
   - Hot module replacement for development
   - Optimized production builds

2. **Type-Safe Adventure System**
   - Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
   - Support for 9 different scene types
   - Flexible quiz system
   - Learning points tracking

3. **Progress Management**
   - Auto-save to browser IndexedDB
   - Export progress as JSON
   - Import progress from file
   - Statistics tracking

4. **Asset Management**
   - Preloading system
   - Caching for smooth playback
   - Placeholder generation script

5. **Arabian Nights Adventure (Chapter 1)**
   - Complete narrative-driven chapter (30-35 minutes)
   - 9 story scenes
   - 10-question quiz
   - Learning objectives and points

6. **UI Components**
   - Adventure selection screen

7. **GitHub Pages Deployment**
   - Auto-deploy workflow
   - Configured for GitHub Actions

```

## Quick Start

### Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit http://localhost:5173 to see your app!

### Generate Placeholder Assets
Already done! But if you add new assets:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/generatePlaceholders.ts
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Replace Placeholder Assets

Check `/src/adventures/arabian-nights/arabian-nights_assets.md` for:
- List of required images
- Music style requirements
- Color palettes

Create or source real assets and replace the SVG placeholders in `/public/assets/arabian-nights/`

### 2. Add Dante's Inferno

Create a new adventure:
```bash
mkdir src/adventures/dantes-inferno
```

Follow the Arabian Nights structure as a template.

### 3. Implement Remaining Scene Types

Currently only `narrative` scenes are fully implemented. Add:
- Decision scenes (branching narratives)
- Timeline games
- Map exploration
- Primary source analysis
- Dialogue trees
- Cause & effect matching
- Quote attribution
- Anachronism detection

### 4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to Settings → Pages
3. Select "GitHub Actions" as build source
4. Push to main branch triggers auto-deploy

## Testing the Current Build

The Arabian Nights adventure is fully functional with:
- 9 narrative scenes telling Scheherazade's story
- A 10-question quiz testing comprehension
- Progress tracking
- Learning points collection

Try it out and see the experience flow!

## Customization Ideas

- **Themes**: Each adventure can have custom colors, fonts, music
- **Difficulty Levels**: Adjust passing scores
- **Achievements**: Add unlock conditions
- **Teacher Mode**: Track multiple student progress
- **Audio Narration**: Add voice-overs to scenes

## Getting Help

- Check `README.md` for detailed documentation
- See `src/adventures/arabian-nights/index.ts` for adventure structure
- See `src/types/adventure.ts` for all available types

## What's Working Right Now

✅ Adventure selection
✅ Progress saving/loading
✅ Narrative scenes
✅ Quiz system
✅ Learning points tracking
✅ Export/import progress
✅ Asset preloading

## What Needs Implementation

⏸️ Other scene types (decision, timeline, map, etc.)
⏸️ Audio playback controls
⏸️ Achievement system
⏸️ More adventures
⏸️ Accessibility features

**You're all set!** Run `npm run dev` and start exploring. The scaffolding is complete and ready for content creation.
