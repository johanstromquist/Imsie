**Type**: Primary Source Analysis
**Duration**: 3-4 minutes

**Content**:

**Source Material**:
```
Title: Inferno, Canto I, lines 1-3
Author: Dante Alighieri
Date: c. 1308-1320
Type: Text (Italian with English translation)
Citation: The Divine Comedy, translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
```

**Questions**:
1. **What does "midway upon the journey of our life" mean?** (Multiple choice)
   - Options: Birth, Age 35 (midpoint of biblical 70 years), Death, Adolescence
   - Correct: Age 35
   - Explanation: "Biblical lifespan was 70 years (Psalm 90:10). Dante was 35 in 1300, the perfect allegorical midpoint for a crisis of faith."

2. **What does the "dark forest" symbolize?** (Multiple choice)
   - Options: Actual wilderness, Sin and spiritual confusion, Political exile, Mental illness
   - Correct: Sin and spiritual confusion
   - Explanation: "In medieval allegory, forests represented chaos and sin. Being 'lost' meant spiritual disorientation."

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-prologue-3`: "Allegory uses literal events to represent abstract concepts. The dark forest literally represents Dante lost in woods, allegorically represents a soul lost in sin."
- `lp-prologue-4`: "Dante wrote in Italian (not Latin), making literature accessible to common people—a revolutionary act."

---

#### Scene 3: Lost in the Dark Wood (Narrative)
**Type**: Narrative
**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**Content**:
- Dante's fear and confusion
- Cannot remember how he entered
- Desperate to find a way out
- Sees a mountain in the distance (Mount of Joy)
- Begins climbing toward the light

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-prologue-5`: "The mountain represents salvation and virtue. Dante's initial attempt to climb it directly (without guidance) fails—showing human limitations."
- `lp-prologue-6`: "Sleep and forgetfulness in medieval literature often symbolize sin's power to cloud judgment."

---

#### Scene 4: The Three Beasts (Decision Scene)
**Type**: Decision Scene
**Duration**: 3-4 minutes

**Prompt**: "Three beasts block your path up the mountain. Each represents a different obstacle. Which do you fear most?"

**Context**:
"As Dante climbs toward the light, three beasts emerge to block his way: a leopard (spotted and agile), a lion (fierce and proud), and a she-wolf (lean and hungry). Medieval readers would recognize these as symbols."

**Choices**:
1. **The Leopard (Lust and Fraud)**
   - Consequence: "The leopard's spots represent deceit—appearing beautiful but hiding danger. This is the sin of seduction and trickery."
   - Learning Points: `lp-prologue-7`: "The leopard symbolizes lust and fraud (malice). Dante places fraud deeper in Hell than violence because it requires human reason—making it worse."

2. **The Lion (Pride and Violence)**
   - Consequence: "The lion's roar shakes the air. Pride was considered the first sin (Lucifer's fall), making it the root of all evil."
   - Learning Points: `lp-prologue-8`: "The lion represents pride and violence (bestiality). Medieval theology saw pride as the sin that separated humanity from God."

3. **The She-Wolf (Avarice and Greed)**
   - Consequence: "The she-wolf's insatiable hunger drives Dante back down. Greed was seen as the sin plaguing Dante's Florence—especially Church corruption."
   - Learning Points: `lp-prologue-9`: "The she-wolf symbolizes avarice (greed). Dante believed greed corrupted both Church and State in his era."

**Base Learning Points** (shown regardless of choice):
- `lp-prologue-10`: "The three beasts correspond to the three major divisions of Hell: incontinence, violence, and fraud."

**Type**: Narrative
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**Content**:
- Brief passage through the vestibule
- Souls who never chose good or evil
- Running eternally after a blank banner
- Stung by wasps and hornets, worms feed on their blood
- Celestino V and other "neutral" historical figures

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch1-1`: "The vestibule punishes those who never took moral stances. Dante despised neutrality—'The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain neutrality in times of moral crisis.'"
- `lp-ch1-2`: "Contrapasso (punishment fitting crime) begins: They followed nothing in life, so chase a meaningless banner in death. They avoided pain in life, so suffer stings eternally."

---

#### Scene 2: Crossing the Acheron (Narrative)
**Type**: Narrative with character
**Duration**: 3 minutes

**Content**:
- The River Acheron (first boundary)
- Charon the ferryman (angry, demonic)
- Charon refuses to take Dante (still alive)
- Virgil invokes divine will
- Earthquake and fainting spell
- Dante awakens on the other side

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch1-3`: "Rivers divide Hell's regions. Acheron separates the living world from Hell proper. Classical mythology (Charon, river crossings) merges with Christian Hell."
- `lp-ch1-4`: "Dante faints when overwhelmed—a recurring motif showing human frailty before divine mysteries."

---

#### Scene 3: Entering Limbo (Narrative)
**Type**: Narrative
**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**Content**:
- The First Circle: Limbo
- No active punishment—only sighs
- Sadness without hope
- Neither joy nor torment
- Eternal longing without fulfillment

- `lp-ch1-6`: "This is the 'contrapasso' for Limbo: They lived virtuously but lacked Christian revelation. Their punishment is absence—eternal unfulfillment, not torture."

---

#### Scene 4: Why Limbo? (Primary Source)
**Type**: Primary Source Analysis
**Duration**: 4 minutes

**Content**:
Medieval theology document explaining salvation

**Source**:
```
Title: "Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus" (Outside the Church there is no salvation)
Author: Medieval Church doctrine
Date: Formalized at Council of Florence, 1442
Type: Text (theological document)
```

**Questions**:
1. **According to medieval theology, could virtuous pagans reach Heaven?** (Multiple choice)
   - Correct: "No, because they lacked baptism and Christian faith"

2. **Why does Dante seem uncomfortable with this doctrine?** (Short answer)
   - Keywords: "virtuous, unfair, Homer, Aristotle"
   - Explanation: "Dante revered pagan thinkers. Placing them in Limbo (not deeper Hell) shows his struggle with Church doctrine vs. respect for human achievement."

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch1-7`: "Medieval Christianity taught salvation required baptism and faith in Christ. Virtuous pagans' fate troubled intellectuals who admired classical philosophy."
- `lp-ch1-8`: "Dante's Limbo is controversial: It's technically Hell but functions like a noble afterlife. He bends doctrine to honor his intellectual heroes."

---

   - Content: "Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle debate eternally. Dante calls Aristotle 'the master of those who know.'"
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch1-10`: "Aristotle dominated medieval philosophy (via Thomas Aquinas). Dante places him highest among pagans—'master of those who know.'"

3. **The Poets' Circle** (x: 70, y: 50)
   - Content: "Homer, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan. Virgil rejoins them, and they accept Dante as the sixth great poet."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch1-11`: "Dante includes himself among the greatest poets—bold self-positioning that also shows humility (he's #6, they're the masters)."

4. **The Scientists and Mathematicians** (x: 40, y: 70)
   - Content: "Euclid, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and Galen discuss geometry and medicine."

   - Content: "Surprisingly, Dante includes Muslim figures: Saladin (warrior-king) and Avicenna (philosopher). Virtue transcends religion in Limbo."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch1-14`: "Including Muslims in Limbo was radical. Dante recognized virtue and wisdom outside Christianity—challenging Crusade-era prejudices."

7. **The Green Meadow** (x: 50, y: 60) - REQUIRED LOCATION
   - Content: "A verdant meadow where souls walk and converse. No pain, only gentle melancholy."

  name: 'Homer',
  portrait: '/assets/dantes-inferno/portraits/homer.png',
  description: 'Ancient Greek epic poet, author of the Iliad and Odyssey (c. 8th century BCE)',
}
```

**Dialogue Tree**:
**Node 1** (Homer speaks):
- Speaker: `homer`
- Text: "Virgil speaks of you, Dante. He says you carry the burden of poetry forward. Tell me, what drives men to write epics in your modern age?"

**Responses**:
1. "To preserve truth and condemn injustice."
   - Next Node: Homer discusses poetry as moral force
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch1-16`: "Epic poetry traditionally records heroic deeds. Dante innovates: His epic records moral geography and political critique."

2. "To explore the divine mysteries."
   - Next Node: Homer contrasts pagan and Christian themes
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch1-17`: "Classical epics featured gods but lacked monotheistic salvation. Dante's epic integrates Catholic cosmology with epic tradition."

3. "Because Virgil inspired me."
   - Next Node: Homer praises literary inheritance
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch1-18`: "Literature builds on literature. Dante sees himself continuing Homer → Virgil → Ovid → Dante lineage."

   - Context: "Philosopher (384-322 BCE). Founded formal logic and influenced medieval theology."
   - Explanation: "Aristotle's works were rediscovered in the 12th century and Christianized by Thomas Aquinas. Dante revered him as reason's pinnacle."

2. **Plato**: "He who wrote of the ideal Republic"
   - Speaker: Plato
   - Context: "Philosopher (428-348 BCE). Taught Aristotle, wrote dialogues exploring justice and forms."
   - Explanation: "Plato's Theory of Forms influenced Christian Neoplatonism. Augustine adapted Plato for Christianity."

3. **Cicero**: "Rome's greatest orator"
   - Speaker: Cicero
   - Context: "Roman statesman and philosopher (106-43 BCE). Wrote on ethics and rhetoric."
   - Explanation: "Medieval students learned Latin rhetoric from Cicero. His ethical writings aligned with Christian virtue."

4. **Avicenna**: "The Persian physician and philosopher"
   - Speaker: Avicenna (Ibn Sina)
   - Context: "Islamic philosopher (980-1037 CE). Preserved Aristotle's works and advanced medicine."
   - Explanation: "Avicenna's commentaries on Aristotle reached medieval Europe via Arabic-Latin translations. Dante honors cross-cultural intellectual debt."

5. **Orpheus**: "The poet who descended to reclaim his love"
   - Speaker: Orpheus
   - Context: "Mythical Greek poet who traveled to the underworld for Eurydice."
   - Explanation: "Orpheus' underworld journey prefigures Dante's. Myth and literature blend in Dante's creative cosmos."

   - Speaker: Saladin
   - Context: "Sultan of Egypt and Syria (1137-1193). Fought Crusaders but was respected for chivalry."

**Learning Points** (shown at completion):
- `lp-ch1-21`: "Dante's Limbo includes pagans, Muslims, and even mythical figures. He constructs a cosmopolitan intellectual community."
- `lp-ch1-22`: "Classical philosophy reached medieval Europe through Islamic scholars. Avicenna and Averroes preserved and expanded Aristotle's works."

---

#### Scene 9: Classical vs. Christian Worldviews (Decision)
**Type**: Decision Scene
**Duration**: 3 minutes

**Prompt**: "Dante struggles with a contradiction: These noble souls lived virtuously yet are denied Paradise. What is the resolution?"

**Context**:
"Medieval theology demanded baptism and faith for salvation. Yet Aristotle, who died 300+ years before Christ, couldn't have believed. Is eternal exclusion from Paradise just?"

**Choices**:

1. **"Yes, God's justice is perfect even if we don't understand it."**
   - Consequence: "This is the orthodox view. Divine justice transcends human logic. Faith requires accepting paradoxes."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch1-23`: "Medieval theology emphasized divine mystery: God's ways surpass human understanding (Romans 11:33). Questioning doctrine risked heresy."

2. **"No, this seems unjust. Virtue should be rewarded."**
   - Consequence: "Dante seems to agree. He makes Limbo pleasant and honors its inhabitants. This subtle critique questions Church teaching."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch1-24`: "Dante bends doctrine: Limbo isn't torment but melancholy. He honors pagan wisdom while technically obeying Church cosmology."

3. **"Perhaps Christ descended to Limbo and saved some souls."**
   - Consequence: "This refers to the 'Harrowing of Hell'—Christ's descent between crucifixion and resurrection. Some Church fathers taught He freed virtuous pre-Christians."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch1-25`: "The 'Harrowing of Hell' (1 Peter 3:19) says Christ freed Old Testament prophets from Limbo. Dante references this but doesn't fully explore it."

**Base Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch1-26`: "Dante's Limbo reveals tension between classical humanism and Christian exclusivity. Renaissance humanism would later embrace this tension."

#### Scene 11: Understanding Contrapasso (Cause-Effect)
**Type**: Cause-Effect Scene
**Duration**: 3-4 minutes

**Prompt**: "Match each sin to its contrapasso (punishment fitting the crime) for the upcoming circles."

**Pairs** (5 pairs):

1. **Cause**: "Lust: Surrendered reason to passion"
   **Effect**: "Blown by violent winds, unable to control direction"
   **Explanation**: "Lustful souls let emotions control them in life. In death, literal winds blow them helplessly—perfect symbolic justice."

2. **Cause**: "Gluttony: Indulged appetites excessively"
   **Effect**: "Lying in mud and filth, pelted by cold rain"
   **Explanation**: "Gluttons made themselves like pigs. Now they wallow in garbage, becoming what they worshiped."

3. **Cause**: "Greed: Hoarded or wasted material wealth"
   **Effect**: "Pushing heavy weights against each other eternally"
   **Explanation**: "Hoarders and wasters roll boulders representing useless wealth. They meet and fight—their obsession made permanent."

4. **Cause**: "Wrath: Gave in to uncontrolled anger"
   **Effect**: "Fighting in muddy River Styx forever"
   **Explanation**: "The wrathful express anger in life, so fight eternally. The sullen (repressed anger) bubble beneath—choking on unexpressed rage."

5. **Cause**: "Being virtuous but unbaptized"
   **Effect**: "Longing without hope in noble surroundings"
   **Explanation**: "Limbo's residents lacked opportunity, not virtue. Their punishment is absence of God—sadness without torture."

**Distractors** (2 wrong effects):
- "Burned alive in flaming tombs" (This is for heretics in Circle VI)
- "Frozen in ice unable to move" (This is for traitors in Circle IX)

**Learning Points** (shown at completion):
- `lp-ch1-28`: "Contrapasso means 'counter-suffering'—punishments mirror crimes. Dante creates poetic justice where penalty reflects the sin's nature."
- `lp-ch1-29`: "Hell's organization follows Aristotelian ethics: sins of incontinence (weak will) are least severe; sins of malice (intentional evil) are worst."

## Chapter 2: Circles of Incontinence (II-V)

**Status**: Enhanced outline complete
**Estimated scenes**: 13
**Duration**: 35-40 minutes

### Overview

Chapters 2 covers Circles II through V, representing sins of **incontinence** (lack of self-control): lust, gluttony, greed, and wrath. These are considered less severe than violence or fraud because they involve weakness rather than malice. This chapter introduces iconic characters (Paolo and Francesca), explores medieval morality, and deepens the concept of contrapasso.

#### Scene 4: Paolo and Francesca (Dialogue)
**Type**: Dialogue Scene
**Duration**: 6-7 minutes

**Character**:
```typescript
{
  id: 'francesca',
  name: 'Francesca da Rimini',
  portrait: '/assets/dantes-inferno/portraits/francesca.png',
  description: 'Noblewoman of Ravenna (d. 1285), killed alongside her lover Paolo',
}
```

**Dialogue Tree**:

**Node 1** (Francesca speaks):
- Speaker: `francesca`
- Text: "O living creature, gracious and so kind, who through this black air comes to visit us... If we could, we would pray for your peace, since you pity our perverse misfortune."

**Responses**:
1. "How did you come to be here?"
   - Next Node: Francesca explains her story
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch2-7`: "Francesca was married to Gianciotto Malatesta but fell in love with his brother Paolo. When discovered, both were murdered (c. 1285)."

2. "Do you regret your love?"
   - Next Node: Francesca's famous reply about love's compulsion
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch2-8`: "Francesca blames love itself—'Love, which absolves no loved one from loving.' She refuses personal responsibility, a key sign of the damned."

3. "What caused you to sin?"
   - Next Node: The book and Lancelot story
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch2-9`: "Francesca blames a book—the romance of Lancelot and Guinevere. 'That day we read no more.' Literature as temptation was a medieval concern."

**Node 2** (After choice 3 - The Book):
- Speaker: `francesca`
- Text: "We were alone, reading of Lancelot and how love seized him. We read of how the longed-for smile was kissed... When we read the desired smile was kissed by such a lover, he kissed my mouth, trembling. That day we read no more."
- Responses: ["What happened then?", "Where is Paolo now?"]

---

}
```

**Responses**:
1. "Who are you?"

3. "Where are Florence's just men?"
   - Next Node: Ciacco's bitter answer
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch2-16`: "Ciacco says only two just men remain in Florence, 'but no one listens.' Dante's political pessimism pervades Inferno."

- Text: "Tell me: what became of those we loved? Farinata, Tegghiaio, Rusticucci? They meant well—where are they now?"
- Responses: ["I will find them and tell you", "They are deeper in Hell"]

**Node 3** (Ciacco's fate):
- Speaker: `ciacco`
- Text: "When you return to the sweet world, recall me to others' memory. I speak no more."

- Turn around and push back, only to collide again
- Endless futile labor

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch2-19`: "Avarice (greed/hoarding) and prodigality (wasteful spending) are opposites but stem from the same root: obsession with material wealth."
- `lp-ch2-20`: "The contrapasso: They pushed wealth around in life, so push useless weights eternally. Meeting and fighting represents their mutual futility."

---

#### Scene 8: Clergy Among the Greedy (Primary Source)
**Type**: Primary Source Analysis

Analyze Dante's critique of Church corruption

**Source**:
```
Title: Inferno, Canto VII (excerpt)
Author: Dante Alighieri
Date: c. 1308-1320
Type: Text
```

**Text**:
"Here I saw people in greater numbers than elsewhere, from one side and the other, howling loudly, rolling weights with their chests... And many tonsured heads were there—clergymen, popes, and cardinals, in whom avarice works its excess."

**Questions**:
1. **Why does Dante emphasize clergy among the greedy?** (Multiple choice)
   - Correct: "To critique Church corruption—clergy should be spiritual, not materialistic"
   - Explanation: "Dante believed Church corruption (especially papal greed) ruined both spiritual and political life. Placing popes in Hell was radical."

2. **What does 'tonsured heads' mean?** (Multiple choice)
   - Correct: "Shaved crowns indicating clergy"
   - Explanation: "Medieval monks and priests shaved the tops of their heads (tonsure) as a sign of devotion. Seeing them in Hell shocks Dante."

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch2-21`: "Dante attacks Church corruption relentlessly. Popes, cardinals, and clergy appear in multiple circles—showing institutional rot."
- `lp-ch2-22`: "Placing recent popes in Hell risked charges of heresy. Dante's exile gave him freedom to write radical critiques."

- Fortune turns her wheel—raising and lowering humans indifferently

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch2-23`: "Medieval people personified Fortune as a goddess turning a wheel. Dante makes her a servant of God—randomness within divine plan."

- `lp-ch2-26`: "The River Styx from Greek mythology becomes a swamp of wrath. Classical and Christian geography merge seamlessly in Dante's Hell."

---

- Text: "Who are you that comes before your time?"

**Responses**:
1. "I am Dante, passing through."
   - Next Node: Filippo becomes enraged

2. "Who are YOU, so wretched?"
   - Next Node: Filippo attacks verbally
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch2-28`: "Dante's hostility toward Filippo is unusual—he's usually compassionate. Personal hatred breaks through."

- Text: "Away with you, with the other dogs!"
- Speaker: `filippo-argenti`
- Text: [Screams in rage]

- Virgil: "Now begins the city called Dis. Beyond lie the circles of true malice."

- `lp-ch2-31`: "Upper Hell (Circles II-V) punishes incontinence (weakness). Lower Hell punishes malice (intentional evil). The moral distinction is Aristotelian."

---

**Type**: Cause-Effect Scene
**Duration**: 4 minutes

**Prompt**: "Match each sin of incontinence to its contrapasso."

**Pairs** (4 pairs):

1. **Cause**: "Lust: Surrendered reason to passion and physical desire"
   **Effect**: "Blown eternally by violent winds, unable to control direction"
   **Explanation**: "Lustful souls let emotion control them. Now literal winds blow them—perfect symbolic punishment."

2. **Cause**: "Gluttony: Indulged appetites beyond necessity, living like animals"
   **Effect**: "Lying in cold mud and filth, pelted by freezing rain"
   **Explanation**: "Gluttons degraded themselves to animal level. Now they wallow like pigs in garbage."

3. **Cause**: "Greed/Waste: Hoarded wealth or squandered it foolishly"
   **Effect**: "Pushing heavy boulders against each other forever"
   **Explanation**: "Hoarders and wasters obsessed over money. Now they push useless weights—their materialism made permanent and pointless."

4. **Cause**: "Wrath: Gave in to uncontrolled anger or repressed it as sullenness"
   **Effect**: "Fighting in the muddy Styx (wrathful) or choking beneath it (sullen)"
   **Explanation**: "Active wrath fights eternally. Sullen anger (repressed) chokes on itself beneath the surface—unable to express or release."

**Distractors** (2 wrong effects):
- "Burned in flaming tombs" (Heretics, Circle VI)
- "Immersed in boiling blood" (Violent, Circle VII)

**Learning Points** (shown at completion):
- `lp-ch2-32`: "Sins of incontinence stem from lack of self-control, not evil intent. Dante shows compassion—these sinners are weak, not wicked."
- `lp-ch2-33`: "Contrapasso operates on symbolic logic: punishment mirrors the sin's spiritual nature, not just its physical act."

**Content**:
Analyze medieval Church's definition of heresy

**Source**:
```
Title: Summa Theologica, Question on Heresy
Author: Thomas Aquinas
Date: 1265-1274
Type: Theological text
```

**Text excerpt**:
"Heresy is a species of unbelief, belonging to those who profess the Christian faith but corrupt its dogmas... The heretic who disbelieves one article of faith has no faith."

**Questions**:
1. **Why was heresy considered worse than non-belief?** (Multiple choice)
   - Correct: "Because heretics corrupted Christianity from within, threatening the Church"
   - Explanation: "Non-Christians were outside the faith. Heretics were insiders spreading false doctrine—seen as more dangerous."

2. **What punishment did heretics face in life?** (Multiple choice)
   - Correct: "Execution by burning"
   - Explanation: "The Inquisition burned heretics alive. Dante mirrors this with eternal burning tombs."

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch3-8`: "Medieval Christianity tolerated non-believers but harshly punished heretics. Internal dissent threatened Church power."
- `lp-ch3-9`: "The Inquisition (founded 1231) sought out heretics. Dante lived during its peak—heresy trials were common in Florence."

#### Scene 5: Farinata degli Uberti (Dialogue)
**Type**: Dialogue Scene
**Duration**: 6-7 minutes

**Character**:
```typescript
{
  id: 'farinata',
  name: 'Farinata degli Uberti',
  portrait: '/assets/dantes-inferno/portraits/farinata.png',
  description: 'Ghibelline leader of Florence (c. 1212-1264), Epicurean heretic',
}
```

**Dialogue Tree**:

**Responses**:
1. "Who are you?"
   - Next Node: Farinata introduces himself
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch3-10`: "Farinata degli Uberti led the Ghibellines (pro-Emperor faction) in Florence. He defeated Dante's Guelphs (pro-Pope faction) at Montaperti (1260)."

2. "You destroyed my ancestors!"
   - Next Node: Farinata defends his actions
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch3-11`: "Farinata saved Florence from destruction after Montaperti. Though Dante's political enemy, he's portrayed with respect—a noble opponent."

3. "Why are you in Hell?"

- Dante's response implies Guido is dead (though he's alive)
- Cavalcante faints back into the tomb in grief
- Learning Point: `lp-ch3-13`: "Cavalcante's error shows heretics can see future/past but not present—they denied life after death, so their knowledge of 'now' is dead."

- Speaker: `farinata`
- Text: "That weighs on me more than this bed. But tell me: will my family ever return to Florence?"
- Dante prophesies continued exile

- isEnd: true

**Learning Points** (at dialogue completion):
- `lp-ch3-15`: "Dante's encounter with Farinata is deeply personal—enemy yet admirable. This nuance (good people damned for wrong beliefs) challenges simple morality."

2. **Cause**: "Violence against self: Suicide, squandering one's goods"
   **Effect**: "Transformed into bleeding trees, denied human form"
   **Explanation**: "They rejected their God-given bodies. Punishment: They can't have human form. When they speak/break, they bleed."

4. **Cause**: "Violence against God: Sodomy (violating natural law)"

}
```

1. "I am not Boniface. Who are you?"
   - Next Node: Nicholas realizes his error
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-13`: "Nicholas expects Pope Boniface VIII (Dante's enemy) to arrive soon. Even popes are damned—institutional corruption."

2. "What is simony?"
   - Next Node: Nicholas explains selling Church offices
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-14`: "Simony (named for Simon Magus who tried to buy apostolic power) is selling spiritual offices for money. Dante saw it destroying the Church."

3. "Why are you punished this way?"
   - Next Node: Explains the contrapasso
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-15`: "Simoniacs inverted spiritual priorities (put money above God). Inverted in holes, pushed down by each new arrival—their greed made eternal pressure."

**Node 2** (Nicholas's confession):
- Speaker: `pope-nicholas-iii`
- Text: "I was a son of the she-bear, so eager to advance the cubs that up there I pocketed wealth, and here I pocket myself."
- Learning Point: `lp-ch4-16`: "'Son of the she-bear' refers to the Orsini family (orso = bear). Nicholas enriched relatives through nepotism."

**Node 3** (Dante's rebuke):

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch4-18`: "Sorcerers tried to see the future through forbidden means. Now they cannot see ahead at all—only behind."

```typescript
{
  id: 'ulysses',

  portrait: '/assets/dantes-inferno/portraits/ulysses.png',
  description: 'Greek hero of the Trojan War, famous for cunning and the Trojan Horse',
}
```

**Dialogue Tree**:

**Node 1** (Virgil addresses the flame):
- Speaker: `virgil`
- Text: "You within the fire, if I deserved of you while I lived... stay and speak! Tell us where you went to die."

**Responses** (from Ulysses):
1. "Why are you in Hell? You're a hero!"
   - Next Node: Ulysses explains his sins
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-26`: "Ulysses is punished for fraudulent counsel: the Trojan Horse, deceiving Achilles, stealing Athena's statue. Cunning without virtue damns."

**Node 2** (Ulysses's final voyage):
- Speaker: `ulysses`
- Text: "When I departed from Circe... neither fondness for my son, nor pity for my old father, nor love for Penelope could conquer my ardor to gain experience of the world."
- Learning Point: `lp-ch4-27`: "Ulysses abandoned duty for forbidden knowledge—sailing beyond the known world. Renaissance spirit (exploration) but medieval sin (pride, curiosity)."

**Node 3** (The speech to his men):
- Speaker: `ulysses`
- Text: "'O brothers,' I said, 'you who through a hundred thousand dangers have reached the West, do not deny this brief vigil of your senses what remains. Consider your origin: You were not made to live like brutes, but to pursue virtue and knowledge.'"
- Learning Point: `lp-ch4-28`: "This is one of literature's great speeches. Ulysses' eloquence shows why he's both admirable and damned—noble ideals, sinful execution."

**Node 4** (The mountain and whirlpool):
- Speaker: `ulysses`
- Text: "We turned our stern toward morning and made wings of our oars for the mad flight... A mountain appeared, dark in the distance... Then the sea closed over us."
- Learning Point: `lp-ch4-29`: "The mountain is Mount Purgatory. God sinks Ulysses' ship—humans cannot reach salvation through reason/exploration alone. Grace is required."
- isEnd: true

**Learning Points** (at dialogue completion):
- `lp-ch4-30`: "Dante admires Ulysses but condemns him. This tension—heroic yet damned—captures medieval ambivalence toward classical virtues."

---

#### Scene 9: Understanding Ulysses (Primary Source)
**Type**: Primary Source Analysis
**Duration**: 4 minutes

**Content**:
Compare classical Ulysses to Dante's version

**Sources**:
```
Title 1: The Odyssey (Homer)
Title 2: Inferno, Canto XXVI (Dante)
Date: c. 8th century BCE vs. c. 1308-1320 CE
```

**Questions**:
1. **How does Dante's Ulysses differ from Homer's?** (Multiple choice)
   - Correct: "Dante invents Ulysses' final voyage and death—not in Homer"
   - Explanation: "Homer's Ulysses returns home. Dante creates a final voyage beyond Gibraltar, ending in death—reflecting medieval fears of forbidden knowledge."

2. **Why is Ulysses' speech both inspiring and sinful?** (Short answer)
   - Keywords: "virtue knowledge pride limits"
   - Explanation: "Ulysses exalts virtue and knowledge—Renaissance ideals. But he violates divine limits, abandoning duty for curiosity—medieval sin."

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch4-31`: "Dante rewrites classical mythology to fit Christian morality. Ulysses' heroism becomes sin when it violates God's boundaries."
- `lp-ch4-32`: "The Ulysses canto foreshadows the Renaissance: pursuit of knowledge as both noble and dangerous."

---

#### Scene 10: The Sowers of Discord (Narrative - graphic)
**Type**: Narrative
**Duration**: 3-4 minutes

**Content**:
- Bertran de Born carries his own severed head like a lantern
- Muhammad split from neck to groin
- A demon hacks them as they pass, wounds heal, they return to be hacked again
- Endless cycle of division and healing

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch4-33`: "Sowers of discord divided communities. They're physically divided—wounds heal, cycle repeats. The sin made eternal."
- `lp-ch4-34`: "Dante places Muhammad here (not as prophet but as schismatic who divided Christianity). Medieval view, now considered deeply problematic."
- `lp-ch4-35`: "Bertran de Born divided father and son (Henry II and Prince Henry). Carries severed head—body divided from reason."

---

**Content**:
- Souls covered in scabs, scratching furiously
- Alchemists (falsified metals)
- Counterfeiters (falsified money)
- Perjurers (falsified words)
- All rotting, diseased, insane

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch4-36`: "Falsifiers corrupted reality—metals, identities, truth. Disease corrupts their bodies—falsification reflected in physical decay."
- `lp-ch4-37`: "Medieval medicine believed disease came from inner corruption. Falsifiers' moral corruption becomes physical contagion."

---

#### Scene 12: Master Adam the Counterfeiter (Dialogue)
**Type**: Dialogue Scene
**Duration**: 3-4 minutes

**Character**:
```typescript
{
  id: 'master-adam',
  name: 'Master Adam',
  portrait: '/assets/dantes-inferno/portraits/master-adam.png',
  description: 'English counterfeiter (d. 1281), burned alive for making false florins',
}
```

**Dialogue Tree**:

**Node 1** (Master Adam speaks):
- Speaker: `master-adam`
- Text: "I had everything I wanted there [in life], and here I crave a drop of water. The little brooks that from the green hills... make their channels cool and soft, are always in my mind, and that image withers me more than this disease."

**Responses**:
1. "What did you falsify?"
   - Next Node: Explains counterfeiting florins
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-38`: "Master Adam counterfeited Florence's gold florin (trusted currency). His crime destabilized economy—personal greed, public harm."

2. "Why are you so thirsty?"
   - Next Node: The contrapasso
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-39`: "Counterfeiters falsified gold (associated with water in alchemy). Dropsy disease causes unquenchable thirst—wanting what they corrupted."

3. "Do you regret it?"
   - Next Node: He fantasizes about revenge on those who hired him
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-40`: "Master Adam blames employers, not himself. The damned never accept responsibility—impenitence defines Hell."

**Node 2** (Fight with Sinon):
- Master Adam and Sinon (who lied about the Trojan Horse) argue and strike each other
- Dante watches fascinated
- Virgil rebukes Dante for enjoying the spectacle
- Learning Point: `lp-ch4-41`: "Virgil's rebuke teaches Dante: Taking pleasure in others' degradation, even the damned, is itself sinful."
- isEnd: true

---

#### Scene 13: Reflections on Fraud (Decision)
**Type**: Decision Scene
**Duration**: 3-4 minutes

**Prompt**: "Virgil asks: 'Of all the types of fraud you've seen, which is worst?'"

**Context**:
"You've witnessed ten types of fraud, from seduction to falsification. Medieval ethics ranked sins by their damage. Which does the most harm?"

**Choices**:

1. **"Simony—corrupting the Church corrupts souls."**
   - Consequence: "This aligns with Dante's view. Corrupt clergy mislead entire populations, multiplying sin."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-42`: "Dante reserves special fury for simoniacs. Church corruption damns both clergy and flock—institutional betrayal of the highest order."

2. **"Fraudulent counsel—like Ulysses' deceptive advice."**
   - Consequence: "Evil advice shapes actions. Ulysses' Trojan Horse killed thousands. Ideas have consequences."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-43`: "Fraudulent counselors weaponize intelligence. They use reason (God's gift) for evil—perverting humanity's highest faculty."

3. **"Sowing discord—destroying communities and unity."**
   - Consequence: "Discord-sowers fracture society. Muhammad and Bertran de Born divided religions and families."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-44`: "Medieval society valued unity (one Church, one Empire). Schismatics threatened the entire social order."

4. **"All fraud is equal—it betrays trust."**
   - Consequence: "A fair point. All fraud exploits human relationships, violating the bond of trust essential to society."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-45`: "Fraud is worse than violence because it requires human intelligence. Animals can be violent; only humans can deceive."

**Base Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch4-46`: "Fraud requires reason—humans' divine spark. Using intelligence for evil is worse than bestial violence. That's why fraud is deeper than violence in Hell."

---

#### Scene 14: The Giants at the Pit (Narrative)
**Type**: Narrative
**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**Content**:
- Exiting Malebolge, approaching the final pit
- Enormous forms in the mist—the Giants
- Nimrod (Tower of Babel), Ephialtes, others
- They're chained, guarding the pit to Cocytus
- Antaeus (unchained) will lower them down

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch4-47`: "Giants represent prideful rebellion against God. They're too dangerous for any circle—used as guards/tools instead."
- `lp-ch4-48`: "Nimrod speaks gibberish—his Tower of Babel caused linguistic confusion. His punishment is incomprehensibility."

---

#### Scene 15: Descent to Cocytus (Narrative)
**Type**: Narrative
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**Content**:
- Antaeus lowers Dante and Virgil into the pit
- Descending into icy darkness
- The air grows frigid
- They land on frozen Cocytus
- Preparation for Circle IX

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch4-49`: "The descent from fire (Malebolge) to ice (Cocytus) represents evil's progression. Fraud is 'hot' passion; treachery is 'cold' calculation."
- `lp-ch4-50`: "Hell's very bottom is frozen, not fire—medieval inversion. Ultimate evil is coldness of heart, absence of love's warmth."

---

#### Scene 16: Fraud vs. Treachery (Decision)
**Type**: Decision Scene
**Duration**: 3 minutes

**Prompt**: "Why is treachery (Circle IX) worse than fraud (Circle VIII)?"

**Context**:
"Both involve deception. What makes betrayal of trust worse than other fraud?"

**Choices**:

1. **"Treachery betrays special relationships (family, country, guests, benefactors)."**
   - Consequence: "Correct. Treachery violates bonds that should be sacred. Fraud deceives strangers; treachery betrays intimates."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-51`: "Treachery destroys love—betraying those who trust you most. It's the coldest sin, closest to Satan."

2. **"Treachery is premeditated—calculated, not impulsive."**
   - Consequence: "True. Traitors plan betrayals carefully. Cold calculation is worse than hot passion."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-52`: "Premeditation makes sin worse. Treachery requires sustained evil intent—not momentary weakness."

3. **"Actually, fraud seems worse—it affects more people."**
   - Consequence: "Dante disagrees. Treachery's intensity (depth of betrayal) exceeds fraud's breadth (number affected)."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch4-53`: "Medieval ethics valued quality over quantity. Betraying one intimate is worse than deceiving many strangers."

**Base Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch4-54`: "Hell's structure is moral: incontinence (weakness) → violence (malice) → fraud (intelligent evil) → treachery (betrayal of love). Each level colder, more calculated."

---

#### Scene 17: Types of Fraud Matching (Timeline Game)
**Type**: Timeline Game

8. **Bolgia 8**: Fraudulent Counselors (Ulysses)
9. **Bolgia 9**: Sowers of Discord
10. **Bolgia 10**: Falsifiers

**Explanation** (shown at completion):
"Malebolge descends in rings. Each bolgia punishes a specific type of fraud, from seduction (outer) to falsification (inner). The structure shows fraud's many faces—all requiring intelligent deception."

**Learning Points** (shown at completion):
- `lp-ch4-55`: "The ten bolgias systematically categorize fraud. Dante creates a taxonomy of deception—medieval scholastic method applied to sin."
- `lp-ch4-56`: "Fraudulent counselors (Bolgia 8) and sowers of discord (Bolgia 9) are deepest—intellectual sins worse than physical theft or seduction."

---

#### Scene 18: Understanding Fraud (Cause-Effect)
**Type**: Cause-Effect Scene
**Duration**: 4-5 minutes

**Prompt**: "Match each type of fraud to its contrapasso."

**Pairs** (6 pairs):

1. **Cause**: "Simony: Selling Church offices for money"
   **Effect**: "Upside-down in stone holes with feet burning"
   **Explanation**: "They inverted spiritual priorities. Upside-down position reflects inversion; fire burns where they walked—their evil path aflame."

2. **Cause**: "Sorcery: Attempting to see the future through forbidden means"
   **Effect**: "Heads twisted backward, unable to see forward"
   **Explanation**: "They perverted vision. Now cannot see ahead—only behind. Perfect symbolic punishment for false prophecy."

3. **Cause**: "Hypocrisy: Appearing virtuous while hiding vice"
   **Effect**: "Gilded lead cloaks, beautiful outside but crushing inside"
   **Explanation**: "External beauty concealed inner corruption. Cloaks replicate their duality—golden appearance, leaden reality."

4. **Cause**: "Theft: Stealing others' property and identity"
   **Effect**: "Bitten by serpents, bodies transformed, identities stolen"
   **Explanation**: "They stole from others. Serpents steal their human forms—losing self mirrors their thefts."

5. **Cause**: "Fraudulent counsel: Giving deceptive advice"
   **Effect**: "Wrapped in flames, hidden like tongues of fire"
   **Explanation**: "They hid truth in false words. Now hidden in flames—their cunning intellect burns them."

6. **Cause**: "Sowing discord: Dividing communities, families, religions"
   **Effect**: "Hacked apart by demons, wounds heal, cycle repeats"
   **Explanation**: "They divided others. Now eternally divided themselves—bodies split, reassemble, split again."

**Distractors** (2 wrong effects):
- "Blown by violent winds" (Lustful, Circle II)
- "Frozen in ice unable to move" (Traitors, Circle IX)

**Learning Points** (shown at completion):
- `lp-ch4-57`: "Fraud's contrapasso is intellectual: reversals, transformations, hidden made visible. Punishments mirror the mind's deceptions."
- `lp-ch4-58`: "Dante's creativity peaks in Malebolge. Ten unique punishments show his imaginative range—allegory becomes art."

- "It's actually not worse—violence is deeper"
- "Because the Church said so"

- "It's a medieval error"

**Correct Answer**: "Because ice represents coldness of heart—absence of love's warmth (worst evil)"
**Explanation**: "Medieval inversion: Ultimate evil is cold calculation, not hot passion. Treachery freezes the heart—ultimate absence of love."

## Chapter 5: Treachery - Cocytus & Satan (IX)

**Status**: Enhanced outline complete
**Estimated scenes**: 14
**Duration**: 35-40 minutes

### Overview

Chapter 5 covers **Circle IX (Cocytus)**, the frozen lake at Hell's center where traitors are punished. Divided into four zones (Caina, Antenora, Ptolomea, Judecca), each punishing betrayal of different relationships. Culminates with Satan at the absolute center, eternally chewing three arch-traitors: Judas, Brutus, and Cassius. The chapter ends with Dante and Virgil's climb out of Hell, emerging to see stars—completing the descent and beginning the journey toward redemption.

---

### Detailed Scene Breakdown

#### Scene 1: Landing on Cocytus (Narrative)
**Type**: Narrative
**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**Content**:
- Antaeus sets them on the frozen lake
- Dante accidentally kicks a frozen head
- The head curses him
- Everything is ice—a vast frozen lake
- Souls frozen at various depths

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch5-1`: "Cocytus is frozen—ultimate evil is cold, not hot. Traitors lack love's warmth, frozen in their own betrayals."
- `lp-ch5-2`: "The contrapasso begins: Betrayal isolates. Traitors are frozen alone, unable to move, some unable to speak or even cry."

---

#### Scene 2: The Structure of Treachery (Map Exploration)
**Type**: Map Exploration
**Duration**: 5-6 minutes

**Map**: Top-down view of Cocytus showing four concentric zones

**Locations** (6 clickable points):

1. **Caina (Zone 1)** (x: 40, y: 40) - REQUIRED
   - Content: "Traitors to family. Frozen to neck. Can move heads but not bodies. Named for Cain (killed brother Abel)."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch5-3`: "Caina punishes familial betrayal—the first circle of treachery. Family bonds are sacred; breaking them is deepest evil's outer ring."

2. **Antenora (Zone 2)** (x: 50, y: 50) - REQUIRED
   - Content: "Traitors to country/party. Frozen deeper. Named for Antenor (allegedly betrayed Troy)."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch5-4`: "Political betrayal ranks worse than familial. Dante's exile fuels his fury—traitors destroyed his Florence."

3. **Ptolomea (Zone 3)** (x: 60, y: 60) - REQUIRED
   - Content: "Traitors to guests. Frozen on backs, tears freeze over eyes. Named for Ptolemy (murdered guests at feast)."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch5-5`: "Guest-betrayal violates sacred hospitality laws. Frozen tears prevent weeping—can't express remorse even if they felt it."

4. **Judecca (Zone 4)** (x: 70, y: 70) - REQUIRED
   - Content: "Traitors to benefactors. Completely submerged, various positions. Named for Judas Iscariot (betrayed Jesus)."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch5-6`: "Betraying benefactors is worst treachery. Those who helped you most trusted you—their betrayal is ultimate evil."

5. **Satan's Pit (Center)** (x: 75, y: 75) - REQUIRED
   - Content: "Satan himself, waist-deep in ice, flapping wings (creates freezing wind), chewing three arch-traitors."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch5-7`: "Satan is trapped, not ruling. He's Hell's prisoner, the ultimate traitor (betrayed God). His flapping wings freeze the lake—evil generates its own punishment."

6. **The Exit Passage** (x: 50, y: 90)
   - Content: "A rocky passage leads from Satan's pit down (then up) through Earth's center to Mount Purgatory's base."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch5-8`: "The exit requires passing Satan and climbing through Earth. Escape from Hell means confronting ultimate evil, then ascending."

**Required Locations**: `['caina', 'antenora', 'ptolomea', 'judecca', 'satan-pit']`

#### Scene 3: Understanding Treachery Types (Anachronism)
**Type**: Anachronism Scene
**Duration**: 4-5 minutes

**Prompt**: "Which of these historical betrayals belongs in Cocytus? Identify the traitors."

**Items** (8 items, 6 correct, 2 anachronisms):

**Correct Historical Betrayals:**

1. **Cain killing Abel** (Caina - family betrayal)
   - Period: Biblical antiquity
   - Explanation: "First murder—brother killed brother. Caina is named for him. Familial betrayal begins human sin."

2. **Mordred betraying King Arthur** (Caina/Antenora - family/country)
   - Period: Medieval legend (5th-6th century, but literary 12th century)
   - Explanation: "Mordred betrayed uncle/father figure Arthur and usurped kingdom. Double betrayal—family and country."

3. **Brutus assassinating Julius Caesar** (Judecca - benefactor betrayal)
   - Period: 44 BCE
   - Explanation: "Caesar trusted and promoted Brutus. His betrayal ('Et tu, Brute?') damns him to Satan's mouth."

4. **Judas Iscariot betraying Jesus** (Judecca - ultimate benefactor betrayal)
   - Period: c. 30 CE
   - Explanation: "Betrayed God incarnate for 30 silver pieces. Satan eternally chews Judas in his center mouth—worst traitor."

5. **Count Ugolino betraying Pisa** (Antenora - political betrayal)
   - Period: 1280s
   - Explanation: "Ugolino switched sides in Pisan politics. Later imprisoned with sons and starved. Dante gives him the longest speech in Inferno."

6. **Ptolemy XII murdering dinner guests** (Ptolomea - guest betrayal)
   - Period: 2nd century BCE
   - Explanation: "Invited guests to feast, murdered them. Violating hospitality is sacred crime—hence Ptolomea's name."

**Anachronisms (don't belong—happened after Dante's death):**

1. **Guy Fawkes' Gunpowder Plot (1605)**
   - Why wrong: "1605 is 300+ years after Dante wrote Inferno (c. 1320). Anachronism—doesn't belong in medieval hell."

2. **Benedict Arnold betraying America (1780)**
   - Why wrong: "1780 is 450+ years after Dante. America didn't exist in Dante's time. Clear anachronism."

**Learning Points** (shown at completion):
- `lp-ch5-9`: "Betrayal is universal—every culture has traitors. Dante's categories (family, country, guests, benefactors) span cultures and eras."
- `lp-ch5-10`: "Medieval people knew classical and recent history intimately. Dante mixes Cain, Brutus, and contemporary Italians—sin is timeless."

---

#### Scene 4: Caina - Brothers and Kin (Narrative)
**Type**: Narrative
**Duration**: 2 minutes

**Content**:
- Two brothers frozen face-to-face
- Alessandro and Napoleone degli Alberti
- Killed each other over inheritance
- Forced to stare at each other eternally

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch5-11`: "Familial traitors face each other frozen. They destroyed family unity; now stuck forever with their victim/co-sinner."
- `lp-ch5-12`: "Inheritance disputes frequently caused medieval family violence. Dante saw property dividing blood bonds."

---

#### Scene 5: Antenora - Count Ugolino (Dialogue)
**Type**: Dialogue Scene
**Duration**: 7-8 minutes

**Character**:
```typescript
{
  id: 'count-ugolino',
  name: 'Count Ugolino della Gherardesca',
  portrait: '/assets/dantes-inferno/portraits/ugolino.png',
  description: 'Pisan noble (c. 1220-1289), imprisoned and starved with sons/grandsons',
}
```

**Dialogue Tree**:

**Node 1** (Ugolino gnaws another's skull):
- Dante sees one frozen head gnawing another's skull
- Speaker: `count-ugolino`
- Text: "You want me to renew desperate grief... But if my words can plant seeds of infamy for this traitor I gnaw, you'll see me speak and weep together."

**Responses**:
1. "Who is that you're eating?"
   - Next Node: Identifies Archbishop Ruggieri
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch5-13`: "Ruggieri imprisoned Ugolino and his sons/grandsons in a tower, starved them to death. Ugolino's revenge: eternal gnawing."

2. "What happened to you?"
   - Next Node: The Tower of Hunger story begins
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch5-14`: "This is Inferno's most emotionally devastating story. Dante gives Ugolino 60+ lines—longest single speech."

**Node 2** (The Tower):
- Speaker: `count-ugolino`
- Text: "I heard them nailing shut the door below. I looked into my children's faces without speaking. I did not weep—I turned to stone inside... They wept."

**Responses**: ["What happened next?"]

**Node 3** (The sons' deaths):
- Speaker: `count-ugolino`
- Text: "Day after day passed. One by one they fell... I saw them fall dead, the four of them, between the fifth and sixth days. Blind by then, I crawled over each, calling them for two days after they were dead... Then hunger proved stronger than grief."
- Learning Point: `lp-ch5-15`: "The final line is ambiguous: Did Ugolino resort to cannibalism? Dante leaves it uncertain—horrible either way."

**Node 4** (Dante's condemnation):
- Text (narration): "Ah, Pisa! You shame the people of the fair land where 'si' is heard! Since your neighbors are slow to punish you, may Capraia and Gorgona shift and dam the Arno's mouth, drowning every soul in you!"
- Learning Point: `lp-ch5-16`: "Dante erupts with fury at Pisa. Starving children (whatever their father's crimes) is unforgivable. His rage is personal—moral outrage."
- Learning Point: `lp-ch5-17`: "Ugolino is both victim and traitor. He betrayed Pisa politically; Ruggieri betrayed him personally. Both are damned—mutual betrayal."
- isEnd: true

---

#### Scene 6: Ptolomea - Frozen Tears (Narrative)
**Type**: Narrative
**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**Content**:
- Souls frozen on their backs
- Tears freeze immediately, forming crystal visors over eyes
- Cannot weep even if they wanted to
- Complete isolation—can't see, move, or express

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch5-18`: "Guest-traitors' tears freeze instantly. Medieval hospitality was sacred—'breaking bread' created obligation. Violating it deserves frozen tears."
- `lp-ch5-19`: "The frozen tears symbolize impenitence. If they could cry (show remorse), they wouldn't be damned. Frozen tears = frozen hearts."

---

#### Scene 7: Fra Alberigo (Dialogue - shocking twist)
**Type**: Dialogue Scene
**Duration**: 4-5 minutes

**Character**:
```typescript
{
  id: 'fra-alberigo',
  name: 'Fra Alberigo',
  portrait: '/assets/dantes-inferno/portraits/alberigo.png',
  description: 'Jovial Friar who murdered relatives at feast (1285)',
}
```

**Dialogue Tree**:

**Node 1** (A soul calls out):
- Speaker: `fra-alberigo`
- Text: "Remove the hard veils from my face, so I may vent the grief that soaks my heart before tears freeze again."

**Responses**:
1. "Who are you?"
   - Next Node: Alberigo introduces himself
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch5-20`: "Alberigo invited relatives to feast, signaled servants (with fruit course) to murder them. Guest-betrayal at its vilest."

2. "I'll help if you tell me your story."
   - Next Node: Alberigo agrees
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch5-21`: "Dante promises to help, then breaks his promise. Is lying to the damned justified? Moral ambiguity—reader must judge."

**Node 2** (The shocking revelation):
- Speaker: `fra-alberigo`
- Text: "I believe you think I am still alive. But my body still walks the world above. This zone has a special privilege: often the soul falls here before Atropos [death] should send it."
- Learning Point: `lp-ch5-22`: "Shocking theology: Guest-traitors are so evil their souls fall to Hell while bodies still live above, possessed by demons. Dante invents this."

**Node 3** (Dante refuses to help):
- Text (narration): "I did not open his eyes. To be rude to him was courtesy."
- Learning Point: `lp-ch5-23`: "Dante breaks his promise to Alberigo—lying to traitors is 'courtesy.' This moral complexity challenges readers: Is betraying betrayers just?"
- isEnd: true

---

#### Scene 8: Judecca - The Silent Depths (Narrative)
**Type**: Narrative
**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**Content**:
- The innermost zone
- Souls completely submerged in ice
- Frozen in various twisted positions
- No speech possible
- Absolute isolation

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch5-24`: "Judecca is silent—no speech, no interaction. Traitors to benefactors destroyed love completely; they're isolated eternally."
- `lp-ch5-25`: "Complete submersion represents total spiritual death. They cannot communicate, move, or sense—utterly cut off."

---

#### Scene 9: Satan's Appearance (Narrative)
**Type**: Narrative
**Duration**: 3-4 minutes

**Content**:
- A massive form in the distance
- Emperor of the sorrowful kingdom
- Three faces (red, black, pale yellow)
- Six wings (bat-like, not angelic)
- Waist-deep in ice
- Flapping wings—creates freezing wind that keeps Cocytus frozen

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch5-26`: "Satan has three heads—grotesque parody of Holy Trinity. Where Trinity represents unity in love, Satan's heads represent division."
- `lp-ch5-27`: "Satan once had the most beautiful angel wings. Now bat-like and useless—his rebellion grotesquely warped God's gifts."
- `lp-ch5-28`: "Satan doesn't rule Hell—he's imprisoned in it. Flapping wings to escape only freezes him deeper. Evil is self-defeating."

---

#### Scene 10: The Three Arch-Traitors (Narrative with primary source)
**Type**: Primary Source Analysis
**Duration**: 4-5 minutes

**Content**:
Satan's three mouths eternally chew three sinners

**Source**:
```
Title: Inferno, Canto XXXIV
Author: Dante Alighieri
Date: c. 1308-1320
Type: Text
```

**Text**:
"In every mouth he crushed a sinner with his teeth... The one in front—the biting he endures is nothing to the clawing: sometimes his back is stripped completely of its skin. 'That soul up there who suffers most,' my master said, 'is Judas Iscariot: his head inside, he jerks his legs without. Of the other two whose heads hang down, the one from the black face is Brutus—see how he writhes and cannot speak; the other, who seems so robust, is Cassius.'"

**Questions**:
1. **Why these three traitors specifically?** (Multiple choice)
   - Correct: "They betrayed the two supreme authorities: Jesus (divine) and Caesar (earthly)"
   - Explanation: "Medieval worldview had two powers: Church (divine) and Empire (earthly). Judas betrayed God; Brutus and Cassius betrayed the ideal Emperor."

2. **Why is Judas' punishment worst (head inside)?** (Multiple choice)
   - Correct: "Betraying God is worse than betraying earthly power"
   - Explanation: "Judas gets center mouth and worst position. Spiritual betrayal exceeds political betrayal—divine authority outranks human."

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch5-29`: "Dante's politics: Church and Empire should rule together. Judas (anti-Church) and Brutus/Cassius (anti-Empire) destroyed this dual order."
- `lp-ch5-30`: "Judas suffers most despite Brutus/Cassius killing more people. Medieval ethics: quality (who betrayed) exceeds quantity (how many killed)."

---

#### Scene 11: Understanding Satan (Decision)
**Type**: Decision Scene
**Duration**: 3-4 minutes

**Prompt**: "Why is Satan frozen and imprisoned rather than ruling Hell?"

**Context**:
"Popular imagination sees Satan as Hell's king. Dante portrays him as trapped, pathetic prisoner. Why?"

**Choices**:

1. **"Evil is self-defeating—Satan's rebellion trapped himself."**
   - Consequence: "Correct. Rejecting God (infinite good) means choosing nothing. Evil lacks substance—it's absence of good."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch5-31`: "Medieval theology: Evil has no positive existence. It's privation of good (like darkness is absence of light). Satan chose nothing, became imprisoned in nothing."

2. **"God punishes Satan by making him powerless."**
   - Consequence: "Partly true, but misses the point. Satan's punishment comes from his own choice—he imprisoned himself."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch5-32`: "Satan's flapping to escape freezes him deeper. Every evil act worsens the sinner's state—Hell is self-inflicted."

3. **"Satan represents ultimate order, not chaos."**
   - Consequence: "Interesting point. Hell is structured, organized. Evil follows logic—it's ordered toward nothing."
   - Learning Point: `lp-ch5-33`: "Hell's precise structure mirrors Heaven's—both ordered. But Hell orders toward absence (frozen center), Heaven toward presence (God's light)."

**Base Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch5-34`: "Popular culture's powerful, ruling Satan comes later. Dante's Satan is pathetic, trapped, weeping—ultimate failure."

---

#### Scene 12: The Climb from Hell (Narrative with event)
**Type**: Narrative
**Duration**: 3-4 minutes

**Content**:
- Virgil tells Dante to cling to him
- They climb down Satan's fur
- At Satan's waist (Earth's center), they flip—suddenly climbing up
- Dante is confused: "Why are we going down?" Virgil: "We're going up now."
- Passing through Earth's center inverted their orientation
- They climb through a rocky passage

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch5-35`: "Earth's center is gravity's zero point. Satan's waist marks absolute bottom. Beyond this, 'down' becomes 'up'—exiting Hell requires inverting."
- `lp-ch5-36`: "The climb mirrors the descent: to exit Hell, you must face evil (climb Satan), then ascend. No shortcuts—confrontation precedes redemption."

---

#### Scene 13: Emerging to Stars (Narrative)
**Type**: Narrative
**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**Content**:
- The passage opens to fresh air
- Dawn light appears
- They emerge on a shore—the base of Mount Purgatory
- Southern hemisphere, opposite Jerusalem
- The journey has taken from Good Friday night to Easter morning
- Dante sees stars again

**Learning Points**:
- `lp-ch5-37`: "Inferno ends with 'stars'—the same word closing all three parts. Stars represent divine guidance, hope, salvation."
- `lp-ch5-38`: "The timeline: Good Friday (crucifixion) to Easter Sunday (resurrection). Dante's journey mirrors Christ's death and revival—personal resurrection."
- `lp-ch5-39`: "Mount Purgatory rises in the southern ocean, opposite Jerusalem. The geography is theological—Hell (north) vs. Purgatory/Paradise (south)."

---

#### Scene 14: Reflections on Hell (Cause-Effect)
**Type**: Cause-Effect Scene
**Duration**: 4-5 minutes

**Prompt**: "Match each zone of treachery to its contrapasso."

**Pairs** (5 pairs):

1. **Cause**: "Caina: Betraying family (brothers, parents, children)"
   **Effect**: "Frozen to neck, facing each other eternally"
   **Explanation**: "Family bonds are natural and sacred. Betrayers face their victims forever—forced intimacy replacing destroyed love."

2. **Cause**: "Antenora: Betraying country or political party"
   **Effect**: "Frozen deeper, heads free but bodies locked"
   **Explanation**: "Political betrayal destroyed community. Now locked in place—no movement toward reconciliation or escape."

3. **Cause**: "Ptolomea: Betraying guests (violating hospitality)"
   **Effect**: "Frozen on backs, tears freeze over eyes"
   **Explanation**: "Hospitality is sacred—guests trust hosts. Frozen tears show frozen hearts; sealed eyes show spiritual blindness."

4. **Cause**: "Judecca: Betraying benefactors (those who helped you)"
   **Effect**: "Completely submerged, twisted positions, silent"
   **Explanation**: "Ultimate betrayal—benefactors trusted most. Complete submersion = total spiritual death, no communication possible."

5. **Cause**: "Satan: Betraying God (ultimate benefactor and Creator)"
   **Effect**: "Imprisoned in ice, chewing three arch-traitors, wings frozen"
   **Explanation**: "Satan rejected infinite Good. He's trapped at evil's absolute nadir—his power gone, reduced to pathetic chewing."

**Distractors** (2 wrong effects):
- "Wrapped in flames" (Fraudulent counselors, Circle VIII)
- "Transformed into trees" (Suicides, Circle VII)

**Learning Points** (shown at completion):
- `lp-ch5-40`: "Treachery's contrapasso is cold isolation. Betrayal destroys relationships; punishment reflects severed bonds—frozen, alone, silent."
- `lp-ch5-41`: "The four zones rank betrayals by relationship sanctity: family → country → guests → benefactors. Dante structures sin like Aristotle structures virtue."

**Events**:
```typescript
