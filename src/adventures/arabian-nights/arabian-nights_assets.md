## Color Palette

All artwork should harmonize with the adventure's theme colors:
- **Primary Color**: `#1a0f2e` (Deep purple-blue, like night sky)
- **Secondary/Accent Color**: `#d4af37` (Rich gold)
- **Supporting Colors**: Deep blues, purples, warm golds, desert oranges for sunsets, rich reds

## Font

The adventure uses `"Crimson Text", serif` for text. Keep this in mind for any text elements in artwork.

## Style Guidelines

1. **Cultural Authenticity**: Research authentic Middle Eastern/Persian/Arabian art and architecture. Avoid stereotypes.
2. **Age-Appropriate**: Target audience is 16-20 years old. Sophisticated but not too dark or graphic.
3. **Atmospheric**: Each image should contribute to the magical, mysterious atmosphere of the stories.
4. **Narrative Support**: Images should enhance understanding of the story, not distract from it.
5. **Consistency**: Maintain visual consistency across all assets - similar art style, color palette, level of detail.
