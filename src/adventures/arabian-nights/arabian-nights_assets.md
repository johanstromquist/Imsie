## Style Guidelines

3. **Atmospheric**: Each image should contribute to the magical, mysterious atmosphere of the stories.
4. **Narrative Support**: Images should enhance understanding of the story, not distract from it.
5. **Consistency**: Maintain visual consistency across all assets - similar art style, color palette, level of detail.
